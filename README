libnet 1.1 tutorial (https://repolinux.wordpress.com/category/libnet/) sample code

File names are preceded by the order they appear in the tutorial.

To compile everything, just run
$ make

Notice that example 13 will fail to compile if your libnet install lacks libnet_build_icmpv6_echo() and libnet_autobuild_ipv6(). They are available for unix platforms only at (https://github.com/repolho/libnet).
